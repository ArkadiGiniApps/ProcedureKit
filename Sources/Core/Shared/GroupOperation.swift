An `Operation` subclass which enables the grouping

related operations together, thereby creating higher

Additionally, `GroupOperation`s are useful as a way
of creating Operations which may repeat themselves before
subsequent operations can run. For example, authentication
operations.

    /**
     This method is called every time one of the groups child operations
     finish.

     Over-ride this method to enable the following sort of behavior:
    
     ## Error handling.
    
     Typically you will want to have code like this:
    
        if !errors.isEmpty {
            if operation is MyOperation, let error = errors.first as? MyOperation.Error {
                switch error {
                case .AnError:
                  println("Handle the error case")
                }
            }
        }
    
     So, if the errors array is not empty, it is important to know which kind of
     errors the operation may have encountered, and then implement handling of
     any that are necessary.
    
     Note that if an operation has conditions, which fail, they will be returned
     as the first errors.

     ## Move results between operations.
    
     Typically we use `GroupOperation` to
     compose and manage multiple operations into a single unit. This might
     often need to move the results of one operation into the next one. So this
     can be done here.

     - parameter operation: the child `NSOperation` that has just finished.
     - parameter errors: an array of `ErrorType`s.

     assuming that the finishing operation has not started (or finished), and the operation is not
     the finishing operation itself, then we add the operation as a dependency to the finishing
     operation.
    
     The purpose of this is to keep the finishing operation as the last child operation that executes
     when there are no more operations in the group.
