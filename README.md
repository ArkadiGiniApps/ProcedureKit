# Operations

A reusable Swift framework Inspired by WWDC 2015 Advanced NSOperations session. See the session video here: https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=226

I want to stress that this code is heavily influenced by Apple. The only changes I have made so far have been bug fixes, and architectural changes to increase the testability of the classes. In no way am I attempting to assume any sort of credit for this architecture - that goes to [Dave DeLong](https://twitter.com/davedelong) and his team. My motivations are that I want to adopt this code in my own projects, and so require a solid well tested framework which I can integrate with.

While not currently feature compatible with Appleâ€™s sample code, it currently does support the basic concepts, along with some useful observers and conditions.

In addition, the framework is well tested, with approximately 70% coverage. This is known as I wrote it using Xcode 7 but have back ported it to Swift 1.2.

Development of the Swift 2.0 version is the priority, as Swift 1.2 will soon be obsolete in a couple of month. However, any significant additions will be backported. Therefore the versioning of this project will follow this pattern: Swift 1.2: `0.4 -> 0.x` and Swift 2.0: `1.0 -> 1.x`
